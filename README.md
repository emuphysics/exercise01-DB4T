# Exercise 01: First python

In lesson 1 you learned some basic python skills. Now, let's practice! Most weeks, you will be provided some code
to start with, but not this week! This week, you will start from scratch. Start by creating a new file in Spyder.
Then, add code as described below.

## Problem 1

Start by defining a few variables at the top of your code:

1. Create a variable called `major` and use it to store the name of your major.
2. Create a variable called `tacosRating`. Assign an integer between 0 and 10 that reflects your feelings about tacos.
3. Create another variable called `sleepRating` and assign an integer value between 0 and 10 that reflects how much
   you like sleep.
4. Test that this code works by running it and printing out the values of your variables in the console (not in the file
   itself).

## Problem 2

Let's use a function that we haven't tried yet to take input from the keyboard (via the console).

1. Use the `input()` function to store the user's first name
in a variable called `first_name`.
2. Use the `input()` function again to store the user's last name
in a variable called `last_name`.
3. Use the `+` operator to combine the two variables that you created
and store the result in a variable called `full_name`.

## Problem 3

1. Use the `type()` function to determine the data types of each variable that you created using and print the result in the following format:
`   variablename: datatype`
2. Calculate the average of the `tacosRating` and the `sleepRating`.
3. Print out a message to the screen that outputs information to the
  screen in a format similar to:

        My name is Dave and I give tacos a score of 9 out of 10!
        I am Dave Pawlowski and my sleeping enjoyment rating is 8 / 10!
        Based on the factors above, my happiness rating is 8.5 out of 10, or 85.0 %!

    where you have used the appropriate variables from the rest of your code (`first_name`, `tacosRating`, etc.).

## Submitting

To complete this exercise, upload your changes to GitHub in the Exercise 1 repository that you created using the GitHub Classroom link. Look
for the `add files` button at the top of that webpage (which
  might be this page depending on how you are viewing this file).
